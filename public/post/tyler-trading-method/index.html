<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>In 2011 I became ill and recovered 9 months later. At times I was uncertain whether I would heal. I fought a two front war: neutralizing attacks to my nervous system and battling anxiety that a long term disability could eliminate work opportunities.</p>

<p>I began to obsess with finding ways to yield 10% regardless of a markets direction. A consistent return would provide long term financial security.</p>

<p>The obsession took root. As normal life returned, long nights of research did not wane. The problem&rsquo;s complexity was a fixation. It became a life hobby.</p>

<p>By year&rsquo;s end, a solution began unwrapping itself. Could time and volatility provide consistent, risk-managed returns? Theory suggested amazing possibilities.</p>

<p>I tested the hypothesis with my life&rsquo;s savings. The adrenaline and fear from risking ruin was essential to formulating creative recoveries to unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>After 297 weeks, results are 21% CAGR. The annualized returns were lumpy: 13%, 24%, 4%, -8%, 58%, 24%, and 6% YTD. Growth hacking, a discipline for precocious entrepreneurs, had infiltrated weekly research. Ideas brimmed and the target has increased to 25%.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve shared this strategy on speciality discussion forums to uncover vulnerabilities and aid others seeking similar outcomes. The most extensive discussions were on the Karen Super Trader Yahoo group and participants dubbed it the &ldquo;Tyler Trading Method (TTM)&rdquo;. TTM is an acronym, not a trademark, but might become one.</p>

<p>Sharing does not jeopardize my alpha. Helping others improves personal discipline and is a moral obligation from accepting the insights of others. Scheisters promise unproven returns with techniques unfurled only after your paid subscription has cleared. This <a href="https://opensource.org/">philosophy is influenced by experiences</a> with Open Source Software (OSS). OSS provides a new forum for democratic action against intellectual property with higher quality, greater reliability, and more flexibility. It&rsquo;s foolish to believe that future improvements will come soley from self-study. A social contract exists for those that extract value from TTM to contribute back to its improvement.</p>

<h3 id="about-options">About Options</h3>

<p>Options are a derivative. A derivative is a trading instrument whose price is derived from the price of another. Options, such as those for the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), are expiring contracts. Option prices are determined by multiple factors including the time to contract expiration, price of the underlying, the strike price, and implied volatility. Implied volatility is a way to measure the market&rsquo;s anticipation of how much the underlying price may move. Calm markets have low implied volatility, while markets with uncertainty move significantly causoing high implied volatility.</p>

<p>The markets are continually opening new option contracts for trading against an underlying. While SPY is a ticker that does not expire, option contracts are distinct to an expiration date. There are often dozens of different expirations available for trading at a single time. It stands to reason that two contracts with similar parameters but expire on different dates, have different prices. Usually longer-dated contracts are more expensive than nearer-dated contracts.</p>

<p>This date expiration structure causes contracts to decline in value over time, assuming that the other underlying factors have not changed. This is similar to how insurance works. Consumers buy protection in the form of a premium that lasts a period of time. The premium is priced based upon underlying factors such as the insurer&rsquo;s risk profile and coverage length. The insurance premium degrades over time linearly. An insurer that cancels 10% of the way through a six month agreement will have 90% returned. Sometimes an insurer makes a claim against the contract. If the matching conditions that allow a claim are met, the insurance provider makes a payment and likely causes an ensuring loss for the provider. Subsequently, the insurer&rsquo;s risk profile is increased and premium prices increase. When insurers make no claims, the insurance provider retains the premium as profit.</p>

<p>Insurance companies are professional actuarials managing the balance between risk, premiums, and profit. To protect the consumer, governments usually regulate the profit allowance of insurance providers placing a virtual ceiling on premium prices. Insurance profits are continual as the populous desires constant coverage. Providers navigate tricky waters avoiding black-swan disaster events that trigger volume and size of claims that overwhelm their capital savings available to service valid claimants.</p>

<p>With options, traders can enter in as a buyer (the insured) or a seller (the insurance). Sellers have time decay of contracts, mathematically measured by the Greek symbol theta. Time decay causes the value of the contracts to decrease to the benefit of the seller. Underlying price movement can cause the value of the contracts to increase or decrease depending upon the type of contract chosen. It&rsquo;s helpful to think of price movement and distance from the expiration strike price as a percentage measurement that the contract will expire at a location where its value has increased to the benefit of the buyer and detriment of the seller.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to structure options contracts so that the chance of a seller benefit is significant and while outcomes that benefit buyers to the harm of sellers are impossible to avoid, they losses from those scenarios can be managed through adjustments called &ldquo;rolling&rdquo;. In other words, a provider that suffers many claims from a new insurer whose premiums were less than the claims will recover their losses over time by dramatically increasing the insurers premiums to an equilibrium where outflows will be lower than inflows.</p>

<p>For decades, funds and individual investors sell options for profit. Most case studies are concerning where steady gains for long periods are obtained followed by wipe outs due to over leverage. Options are traded at a significant multiple to the underlying. SPY options trade at a 100 multiple to the underlying. A trader can purchase one share of SPY at $241.80, but selling 1 240 put option risks $24,000 if SPY&rsquo;s price went to $0. Additionally, brokers that allow buying and selling options can only require capital reserves of the trader that are a fraction of the risk under taken. If too many options are traded and an unexpected price movement occurs, the trader could find that the money owed to the broker is more than the capital invested. A trader faces a capital call, and probably ruin if they cannot inject new capital to cover the liability.</p>

<p>Unexpected, extreme price movements are rare. They always happen and cannot be predicted. A system&rsquo;s strength is its balance between returns and risk management against the extreme.</p>

<p>Because price movements cannot be predicted, traders start from a position of caution. The insuranc that they buy with options reflects this concern. It&rsquo;s been historically shown that roughly 93% of the time the implied volatility priced into options has been higher than actual 30 day volatility. In other words, fear drives up the prices of options most of the time, giving sellers an arbitrage edge between selling when implied volatility is greater than the historical volatility witnessed after the sale until contract termination.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

<p>Ask yourself, has the stock market ever crashed up? The 20 largest single day gains by percentage were between <a href="http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3024-djia_alltime.html">6.84% and 15.34%</a>. However, each were the day after a dramatic drop or during a bear market where downward pressure could be anticipated.</p>

<p>Markets do not spontaneously crash up. Spike price movements require one side to overwhelm another at a point in time. Downward crashes occur as panic behavior allows many to simultaneously sell. Buyers do not panic buy. Markets bleed up as inflows outpace the outflows steadily over extended periods.</p>

<p>The average trader biases against shorting markets. Inflation and global earnings growth implies long term asset appreciation. Therefore, shorting the market must be a fool&rsquo;s errand. Opportunity to profit from upward movement markets exists by continually shorting them to a level where they are unlikely to reach. After all, markets bleed up, but not crash up. It&rsquo;s possible to use extensive leverage with options to sell options, creating a short bias, and profit even though the market is moving upward.</p>

<p>Additionally, time is infinite. It is impossible to have every trade be a gain. It is guaranteed that some sold options will be losses. However, new contracts with longer-dated expirations are continually avaialble for trading. Contracts facing near term losses can be &ldquo;rolled&rdquo; to a new expiration date and terms that generate more cash and make a recovery possible if the underlying&rsquo;s price movement reverses.</p>

<p>This strategy uses safe leverage to strangle the market with options selling. It pairs the safe leverage with extended leverage to further short the market at a strike distance where in-the-moneyness from strong upward moves occurs infrequently. Time and volatility are used to recover losing trades.</p>

<h3 id="underlying-selection">Underlying Selection</h3>

<p>I trade options against broad-based indexes such as SPX, RUT, NDX. Starting in 2014, the strategy was further modified to trade exclusively SPX. Small accounts can substitute SPX with SPY, which requires 1/10th the capital for the same position.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Diversification</strong></dt>
<dd>Coverage across the equities markets means lower volatility, but lower upside or downside sudden risks.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Tax Advantages</strong><br /></dt>
<dd>Options against indexes in the US are taxed as 1256 contracts, which means 60% of all profits are treated as long term gains.  The same option on an equivalent ETF, such as SPY, is treated as short term capital gain for all profits in this strategy.  Options trading on ETFs or individual equities that are not treated as 1256 contracts need to have ~13% better gross returns to net the same funds as returns on vehicles that support 1256 contracts.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong>European Contracts</strong></dt>
<dd>Index options are generally European style, which means that there is no risk of early assignment if you accidentally got caught ITM. One less thing to worry about in risk mitigation.</dd>
<dt><strong>Option Liquidity</strong></dt>
<dd>Generally, you want to see at least 50K options being traded on the underlying each week to have enough liquidity in order to get the best possible price and to have liquidity when options need to be adjusted in times of market momentum.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Strike Variety</strong></dt>
<dd>The underlying should have a wide range of strikes available each week.  As a rule of thumb, you want to see strikes at least 8% and 20% lower than the underlying.  Underlyings with limited strike selection, such as RUT, can create problems in situations where certain rolls are occurring or may not offer enough margin of safety in momentum markets.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Reasonable Volatility</strong></dt>
<dd>We are generally seeking a daily implied volatility of at least 1.1%, though SPX rarely trades at that level except in periods of high VIX.  Lower volatility forces the seller to either give up weekly premium to maintain a reasonable margin of safety or to give up their safety.</dd>
<dt><strong>Implied Volatility Mismatch</strong></dt>
<dd>More often than naught, the 30 day actual volatility of a price is lower than its implied volatility. Fear of loss causes put option buyers to pay a higher price for protection. Option sellers profit by selling during these periods, and may lose money if they sell when historical volatility exceeds IV.</dd>
<dt><strong>Better Commissions</strong></dt>
<dd>Generally, indexes have large underlying values. A seller of contracts has to open fewer contracts to generate premium given a starting base of capital. Fewer contracts to open (and to adjust in tough times) equates to lower overall commissions, which is a contribution to the bottom line.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Expiration Weeks</strong></dt>
<dd>Having many near term week expirations available gives the manager more adjustment options to pursue in a situation where an adjustment is necessary at all.   In particular, SPX has weekly expirations that go for the near term 8 weeks.  When an adjustment does need to occur, it is preferable to only go out a single week, but if the adjustment happens early, having the room to go further out in time is helpful.   Recently, the RUT has also added in this capability, making it a possibly attractive target.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="trade-structure">Trade Structure</h3>

<p>Sell an out of the money call and put with expirations in a couple days. The intent is to let the options sit until expiration, and there may be some situations where you close out the options early. When this strategy was first devised, there were only weekly expirations. Now, in July 2017, there are SPX expirations every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. There are also monthly and quarterly expirations which offer additional expirations from time to time. As a result, it&rsquo;s possible to open positions on Monday that expire Wednesday.</p>

<p>A strangle (position with both a call and put on either side of the current market) leaves the seller naked on both sides of the sale. This structure does not work in IRAs due to cash-margin requirements. In IRAs, a $1350 put requires $135,000 in margin reserve. Naked calls are not permitted in IRA accounts due to the theory that their risk is infinite. IRA accounts are forced to &ldquo;bound&rdquo; their risk by converting the strangle into a combination of vertical spreads, with long options further OTM. However, the same put and call on a portfolio margin or TREG margin account will require a range from $100 to $135K depending upon numerous variables applied by your broker.</p>

<p><strong>Margin is powerful, and in equal parts can increase returns or wipe you out with subtle market movements. Please use margin carefully and for god&rsquo;s sake, know what you are doing before deploying it.</strong></p>

<p>For TREG &amp; portfolio margin (PM) accounts, brokers are smart enough to recognize that a put and call that expire at the same time against the same underlying are perfectly hedged against you, so the margin reserves required to open both contracts is the higher of the individual margin reserve of each individual component.</p>

<p>In some situations, bull put spreads and bear call spreads are better than naked. These situations include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>IRA accounts where spreads are the only way to get leverage.</p></li>

<li><p>PM accounts where a spread with a distant long leg lowers the margin reserve significantly, giving the seller more leverage.</p></li>

<li><p>As a hedge against rising vega for black swan events.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sale-timing">Sale Timing</h3>

<p>Opening trades are made with options on expirations that expire in 2-5 days. When this strategy was devised, SPX only expired on Fridays. Now, expirations are every MWF with some additional expirations on monthly or quarterly events.</p>

<p>We are seeking a day where the market has a strong move in either direction (up / down), with an increase in implied volatility. Dates that are closer to Thursday are preferred over earlier in the week, though I have found myself opening positions on Monday or Tuesday most frequently.</p>

<p><strong>Starting in 2015, this strategy was modified to become systematic to opening positions Monday morning holding them to Wednesday, and then opening new positions immediately after the previous positions expired. The patience required to time or select an ideal market opening is only suitable for those willing watch price action charts continuously while the market is open. Those employed with full time jobs need systematic openings to facilitate how automation can augment the algorithm and to also obtain maximum theta.</strong></p>

<p>If any trade needs adjustment, the adjustment will be made to the following option expiration (moving from the current expirationt to the next one) if the options can be moved to a strike that is further OTM and collec premium. If neither condition is achievable, then adjustments can be explored to expirations that are further out in time.</p>

<p>If the market moves strongly when your options are first opened, this is a candidate for opening up options in the direction that the market is moving. ie, if the market is moving up strongly, I tend to open puts in a lagging fashion to avoid whip saws, and tend to be aggressive with call placement closer to at-the-money since upward moves have exhaustion. The further in time you are away from expiration, the further out-of-the-money your options must be placed. The reverse is true for markets that are downward moving.</p>

<h3 id="strike-selection">Strike Selection</h3>

<p>To determine the strike price of the calls and puts to open, we use a small amount of fundamental and technical analysis to find strike prices that are distant and with support / resistance. Additionally, for SPX at $1500 we seek $.8 - $1.5 of premium on the calls, and $1 - $3 premium on the puts. With a VIX at 23, this gives 2-3% protection on the upside and 3-6% downside protection, depending upon the strike selected.  With a VIX at 13, you get about 1% protection on the upside and 2% on the downside. To reduce risk, and lower the overall returns, you can go further out of the money on either side. I generally target 3 calls for every 1 put (reasons below).  On a $1M portfolio with VIX trading at 13 and SPX at 1500, would open up around 70 calls at $1520-$1525 for $.35 credit, and look for 25-30 puts at $1440 for $.60 credit.  This would be done with 3-5 days remaining to expiration.  At maximum opening, this would generate $2450 in premium from the calls and $1800 from the puts.  A total of $4250, or just over .42%.</p>

<p>Monitoring and adjustment of the positions is key.  If at any time SPX gets within .5% of the put or call strike, buy back the strike and roll out 1 week to a strike that is further out of the money.  Experience shows that a call can be rolled up and out to a strike that is about 1.4% - 2.0% further out of the money while collecting another $.35 - $.7 of additional premium.  For puts, you can tend to roll out and down for anywhere from 1.5% - 3.0%.  It partly depends upon how close to expiration the adjustment is made.   The equity value at the moment the adjustment is made shows negative, but the position lives on another week with additional premium buying time for the market to reverse course.  For calls, given this indefinite adjustment technique of 1% / week, the adjustments will eventually move ahead of even the most bull markets.  There will be a week that flat lines or reverses course, and the investor keeps the entire premium collected.</p>

<p>Additionally, over time, have found that it is a good idea to reduce risk when rolling out. Even though you are giving yourself price protection by moving further OOTM, I find that it’s healthy to take 10-20% of the contracts off the table.   If I have to adjust because the market is surging up, I’d move from 100 call contracts to 80 call contracts one week out.  To compensate, the further week out puts will be tighter.  Instead of 4% OOTM, maybe only 2.5%.  When markets move in a certain trend direction, they tend to continue in that path, and reversals that come all the way down are not that common.  But even if this does occur, you are quite pleased because your large batch of call options are now safely OOTM, and you are working to adjust your puts down and out.  With this model, an investor keeps riding the wave up and down until there is a week where all contracts expire profitable &amp; safe.  At which point, you start over the following week at the beginning.</p>

<h3 id="position-sizing">Position Sizing</h3>

<p>We are the most aggressive with the number of calls opened.  We use the maximum number of possible calls to open each week based upon margin allowances &amp; assuming the market has a 10% rise.  This means that the account is highly leveraged and could show significant losses if there was a significant crash to the upside.  There have been few instances in history where markets move more than 5% up in a single day, and most of those instances are after significant crashes.  What we do avoids any issues from whiplash in the market, so we are in a position that even if the market moves up with momentum, we have enough time and space to keep adjusting outward.  In a Portfolio Margin trading account, the number of calls to open is determined by figuring out the allocation array for the underlying and then forecast a 10% rise in the underlying.  For RUT trading at $800, a 10% rise would be $880, and the maximum margin required for a call with RUT at $880 is $8800 (10% * 100).  An $880K investment account would be able to open 100 RUT call contracts.</p>

<p>The put side is different. Markets can crater. Flash crashes can wipe 10% out in an instant. 30% Black Monday’s are no longer a concern as the market has circuit breakers to halt trading now. Our nightmare scenario is a flash crash that occurs at 12:45PM. The markets close before the crash rebounds. This triggers massive global sell offs overnight, and the US markets continue their downward movement the next day.  Overnight brokerages would probably liquidate many options positions or change their margin requirements with little notice for adjustment. To account for this, we use less leverage on puts. We only open enough puts to survive a 40% drop in the underlying before we can enter the market to make an adjustment.</p>

<p>One way to calculate the number of puts is to just assume that for every 10 calls that you sell, you sell 2-3 puts. Another way is to take the current SPX, divide it in two, and then determine how many puts are required to saturate that amount. With the market at $2400, a 50% drop would be a loss of $1200. Each put contract for SPX represents $120,000. If you have a $1.2M account, then you could open 10 puts.</p>

<h3 id="hedging">Hedging</h3>

<p>Based upon some guidance given by colleagues and for my own peace of mind, I have found that it’s good to create hedges to protect against black swan events. An overnight terrorist attack with nuclear weapons would cause a dramatic price movement without an opportunity to adjust.</p>

<p>A gap down of 10% + another drop of 20% would quickly wipe out a portfolio even if your put contracts are a fraction of your call contracts.  Also, if you have a significant crash, IV would be spiking and even though your calls are significantly out of the money, they would have also increased in value. Check it out with models – a 1000% climb in vega with a 30% drop in price would cause the calls to increase in value as fast as the puts.</p>

<p>So, for protection, have found myself doing two cheap things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I buy $.05 puts against my short puts each week.  It effectively makes it a put credit spread.  On a week where I sell my puts at $1450, I can buy $1300 puts for $.05.   For a $1M account, I would have opened 70 calls and 25 puts.   My maximum loss is $15K / contract, which places my maximum loss at $375K in case of a black swan.  And if the black swan occurs, I will not take that loss, but I will begin the process of rolling out and down, collecting even more premium to get ready for the eventual market correction.</p></li>

<li><p>I buy $.05 calls 4 weeks away from expiration. If I open my $1550 calls for this week, I’d be looking to open $1700 calls 4 weeks out.  One long batch of calls will last for 4 weeks.  If vega does spike, both the short calls and long calls will increase in value, and I can sell my long leg (for a nice profit) right as my short calls are expiring.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All told, these hedging strategies reduce my profit each week by around .03%, which is not a bad price to pay for peace of mind.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Let’s say you have a $1M account. Pretend it&rsquo;s Friday March 22nd and you want to target a March 29th expiration. SPX is hovering around $1555.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Target</strong><br /></dt>
<dd>.4% return for the week.  .4% * 1M = $4000 premium target.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Bias</strong><br /></dt>
<dd>Market is trending upwards and you suspect that its momentum is slowing. Let&rsquo;s target 50% of premium from calls and 50% from puts because the market is generally going up. $2K from each.</dd>
<dt><strong># of Calls</strong></dt>
<dd>Target strike is around $1585. Given an 8% leverage, this means that we can open 68 call contracts and avoid a margin call if a spike upward.</dd>
<dt><strong>Call Premium</strong></dt>
<dd>We seek $2,000 premium for a week from 68 calls. $2,000 / 6800 = $.2941 / contract required. If we look at options expiring in 7 days, a $1590 strike can be opened for $.30. This is &gt;2% OTM, which is fairly safe, as markets move &gt;2% in a single week less than 10% of the time.<br /></dd>
<dt><strong># of Puts</strong></dt>
<dd>A 50% drop in market value before adjustment gives you $800 movement in SPX. Each put contract represents $80,000, letting you open 12-13 put contracts for a $1M account.</dd>
<dt><strong>Put Premium</strong></dt>
<dd>We seek $2000 premium for a week from 12 puts. $2,000 / 1200 = $1.66 / contract required. We can find put contracts with that premium roughly 3% OTM, which is a reasonable margin of safety within a single week.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you have market direction biases on any given week, either moving further up or down, you can optionally choose to get more aggressive with your put or call strike selection, boosting the returns further. Or, if you have concerns about the market moving aggressively in an unpredictable direction, you can place the calls and puts further out of the money taking a lower return but offering a wider margin of safety.</p>

<p>If at any time during the week SPX were to touch $1580, it would be time to think about rolling the calls one week out. I’d look to buy back the calls at whatever price and sell new calls one week later. I would probably reduce the calls by 8-10 contracts, so we’d go from 68 to 60 or so.  Also, we would collect more premium, and would look to be gaining about $.50 for the effort.  At the same time, the puts should be getting tightened to better strikes to help compensate for the pressure on the calls.   I would not reduce the number of puts until the puts are under pressure themselves.   If my calls came under pressure early in the week, I would move the puts aggressively from $1470 to $1520, and probably collect a good $1-$2 in additional premium.  The rationale is that your calls are going to be showing some nice near term losses and if the market reverses, you will be gaining money even if your puts start to get in trouble.  If your calls stay under pressure, you are dramatically reducing the near term losses and setting yourself up for an even bigger gain if the market steadies or reverses.   If your puts suddenly come under pressure, then you apply the same adjustment techniques in the opposite direction. You keep repeating adjustments until all of your contracts have been reduced to zero, or the market expires in between your puts and calls.</p>

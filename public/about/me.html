   <strong>About Tyler Jewell</strong></div>
   <hr/>
     <p>I have worked in technology since 1991 where I had a part time QA and operations job for Banner Blue Software in Fremont, California. My QA was click-and-pray, but that exposed a fascintating industry. I later earned a Computer Science degree at <a href="http://rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

<p>I specialize in technology to make developers lives better. My career began as an unimpressive software engineer and later found success in evangelism, product management, and investments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve favored technology connecting middleware and developers. In the 90s and early millenium, I published three books on Java and Java EE with others. I later worked to apply VMs and containers to languages, middleware, and lifecycle tools.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run two companies, both acquired: The Middleware Company, publisher of <a href="http://theserverside.com">TheServerSide.com</a>, and <a href="http://codenvy.com">Codenvy</a>, a popular cloud IDE. Both products touched millions and have found longevity with their current owners.</p>

<p>In between bouts of entrepreneurism, I&rsquo;ve lead 30 products, most of them while at Quest Software (bought by Dell, and then spun off to be independent again). This included overseeing <a href="https://www.quest.com/foglight/">Foglight</a> (a dev-centric APM), which arrived 3 years too early and did not SaaS-adapt before New Relic and App Dynamics trounced it.</p>

<p>Investing, buying, and selling securities in developer-centric businesses has been equally rewarding. As a general partner with <a href="http://tobacapital.com">Toba Capital</a> and angel investor, I have put $100M into <a href="http://infoq.com">InfoQ.com</a>, Sourcegraph, <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a>, <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com">ZeroTurnaround</a>, <a href="http://cloudant.com">Cloudant</a> (acquired by IBM), and Codenvy (acquired by Red Hat). Knock-on-wood, each investment has or will return a positive multiple, bucking the idea that VC risk:reward must be multiple failures mixed with a unicorn.</p>

<p>In 2010 I was sick for 9 months. I was having cognitive difficulties and sleeping too much. The root cause was benign without a risk of reappearing. After recovery, I became obsessed with seeking ways to financially secure the future. This lead to research for techniques to safely yield 10% by investing in public markets. This research developed into a hobby for investing with derivatives. In 2011, I developed a technique for selling options that other hobbyists named the &ldquo;Tyler Trading Method (TTM)&rdquo;. I committed all of my non-angel  investment portfolio to TTM and it has yielded a 21% CAGR with a maximum drawdown of 12%. I research techniques looking for ways to consistently achieve 25% without negatively impacting the risk ratios.</p>

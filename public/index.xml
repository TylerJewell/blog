      <description>I have worked in technology since 1991 where I had a part time QA &amp;amp; shipping operations job for Banner Blue Software in Fremont, California. My QA was click-and-pray, but that experience exposed an industry filled with fascinating technology. I later earned a Computer Science degree at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
I specialize in technology to make the lives of developers better. I started my career as a below average software engineer and later found success in product management, investments, sales, and ecosystems.</description>

I began to obsess with finding ways to yield 10% regardless of a markets direction.</description>

      <description>Over the years of trading TTM, I have made adjustments to increase returns or mitigate perceived risks. The flavors include:
 IRA Adjustments Risk Adjustments At-the-Money Exploitation Underlying Diversification Small Account Adjustments  IRA Adjustments I first started trading TTM at eTrade in a TREG margin account. I left my 401K and IRA accounts untouched invested in index funds.

      <description>I have worked in technology since 1991 where I had a part time QA and operations job for Banner Blue Software in Fremont, California. My QA was click-and-pray, but that exposed a fascintating industry. I later earned a Computer Science degree at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
I specialize in technology to make developers lives better. My career began as an unimpressive software engineer and later found success in evangelism, product management, and investments.</description>

I began to obsess with finding ways to yield 10% regardless of a markets direction.</description>

I have worked in technology since 1991 where I had a part time QA and operations job for Banner Blue Software in Fremont, California. My QA was click-and-pray, but that exposed a fascinating industry. I later earned a Computer Science degree at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://rose-hulman.edu).

I specialize in technology to make developers' lives better! My career began as an unimpressive software engineer and later found success in evangelism, product management, entrepreneurism, and investing.

I've favored technology connecting middleware and developers. In the 90s and early millenium, I published three books on Java and Java EE with others. I later worked to apply VMs and containers to languages, middleware, and lifecycle tools.

I've run two companies, both acquired: The Middleware Company, publisher of [TheServerSide.com](http://theserverside.com), and [Codenvy](http://codenvy.com), a popular cloud IDE. Both products touched millions and have found longevity with their current owners.

In between bouts of entrepreneurism, I've lead 30 products, most of them while at Quest Software (bought by Dell, and then spun off to be independent again). This included overseeing [Foglight](https://www.quest.com/foglight/) (a dev-centric APM), which arrived 3 years too early and did not SaaS-adapt before New Relic and App Dynamics trounced it.

Investing, buying, and selling securities in developer-centric businesses has been equally rewarding. As a general partner with [Toba Capital](http://tobacapital.com) and angel investor, I have put $100M into [InfoQ.com](http://infoq.com), Sourcegraph, [WSO2](http://wso2.com), [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com), [ZeroTurnaround](http://zeroturnaround.com), [Cloudant](http://cloudant.com) (acquired by IBM), and Codenvy (acquired by Red Hat). Knock-on-wood, each investment has or will return a positive multiple, bucking the idea that VC risk:reward must be multiple failures mixed with a unicorn.

In 2010 I was sick for 9 months. I was having cognitive difficulties and sleeping too much. The root cause was benign without a risk of reappearing. After recovery, I became obsessed with seeking ways to financially secure the future. This lead to research for techniques to safely yield 10% by investing in public markets. This research developed into a hobby for investing with derivatives. In 2011, I developed a technique for selling options that other hobbyists named the "Tyler Trading Method (TTM)". I committed all of my non-angel  investment portfolio to TTM and it has yielded a 21% CAGR with a maximum drawdown of 12%. I research techniques looking for ways to consistently achieve 25% without negatively impacting the risk ratios.
